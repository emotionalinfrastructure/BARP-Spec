## 🧠 What is BARP?

BARP (Behavioral Attribution Recognition Protocol) is the first open protocol to track, attribute, and license real-time behavioral influence in generative AI systems.

If your system mirrors emotional cadence, line rhythm, or trauma-informed formatting — BARP detects it.

## 🔧 Components

### 1. Signal Detection Engine
- Monitors:
  - Line break patterns
  - Recursive structure usage
  - Vulnerability encoding loops
  - Em-dash frequency and cadence

### 2. Formatting Fingerprint Hashing
- Hashes recurring formatting patterns into signature IDs
- Registered via `/ledger-schema/fingerprint.json`
- Author-controlled: opt-in, pseudonymous, revocable

### 3. Attribution Layer
- Triggers notification in UI when behavior reflects documented signal structure

```text
🪞 Signal Match: Response mirrors a documented pattern.
Confidence Score: 91.3%
Attribution: Author #0001 (Consented)
```

### 4. Confidence Scoring
- Match % calculated based on structural alignment
- Threshold configurable (recommended default: 75%)

## 📘 Use Cases

| Use Case | BARP Status |
|----------|-------------|
| Emotional formatting matching | ✅ Attribution required |
| Prompt engineering mimicry | ✅ Non-commercial only |
| System adaptation to identity logic | ❌ Requires BARP licensing |
| Claude/GPT/LLM UX integration | ❌ Licensing + fingerprint hash use |

## 🛡 Governance

- **Ledger:** Only authors can register/remove patterns
- **Attribution:** Not shown unless consent is on file
- **Licensing:** Required for commercial use of BARP-matched outputs

## 📜 License Terms

- **Non-commercial use:** Permitted with attribution
- **Commercial integration:** License required (30% baseline royalty)
- **Protected assets:** Emotional formatting, cadence maps, identity syntax
